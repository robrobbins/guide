<h2>Your moms a Base</h2>
<p>
  Or is it your <code>Base</code> is a mom? Hmm. See all other Class Objects in Sudo.js inherit
  from Base. So even as <code>sudo.Model</code> and <code>sudo.View</code> are 
  out there getting all of the instatiations, <code>Base</code> is selflessly contributing
  itself to their success. Loving, over-dramatic and passive-aggressive, my dear old Base.
</p>
<h2>Sugar For Them What Dislike Sugar</h2>
<p>
  I try to keep away from it generally, as a result so does our friend Sudo.js. You should
  generally just learn how to do things, not learn to do other things that do those things.
  Man that's some poignant shit, let's put that in a blockquote.
</p>

  You know, use standards. We have those now. Want to iterate over an object? Sudo.js says
  "Use <code>Object.keys.forEach</code>". Need to call the <code>contstructor</code>
  method on the <code>prototype</code> chain of the Class Object you inherited from? 
  Sudo.js says "I don't always use syntactic sugar, but when I do I prefer 
  <code>construct</code>."
  <pre>
    var starMonkey = function() {
      this.construct()
    };
    
    // the construct method is inherited from the sudo.Base class
    starMonkey.prototype = Object.create(sudo.Base.prototype);
  </pre>
  That saves you exactly <b>a bunch</b> of characters over the socaially awkward invocation 
  "<code>Object.getPrototypeOf(this).constructor.apply(this, arguments || []);</code>."

<h2>Brendan Eich Didn't Like Comic Books?</h2>
<p>
  I like calling <code>super</code> in other laguages, it's useful and ridiculously named.
  Super? Really? That's amazing. We can't call it, it's not implemented. That makes me sad.
  Not only that, I can't implement it for you with that name becouse of <b>really dumb</b>
  reserved word policies. <i>Sigh</i>. Well, gotta play in the band you are dealt right?
  <pre>
    insertKeysIntoApple: function(keys) {
      this.attachWithRubberBand();
      
      this.base('insertKeysIntoApple', keys);
    };
  </pre> 
  Above we are assuming you have a Class Object that inherited the <code>insertKeysIntoApple</code>
  method from another Class Object and that in the former you want to <code>attachWithRubberBand</code> before
  performing the "superesque" call to the method of the same name on the latter.
</p>
<h3>A note about annoyance</h3>
<p>
  It annoys me to have to make you send the name of the "target" method as the first argument with 
  <code>base</code>. If all the Javascript runtimes had implemented N.F.Es properly you wouldn't have
  too, but they didn't, so you do, and I am.
</p>
<h2>I Would Be More Into Your Code If It Was My Code</h2>
<p>
  Don't deny it, we all feel this way. We're all "I don't want to do it. I want you to do it, but
  you should do it exactly like I would do it while you are doing it." I'm not entirely sure why
  <code>sudo.delegate</code> Class Objects remind me of this <b>universal developer truth</b> but
  they do.
  <pre>
    insertKeysIntoApple: function(keys) {
      this.delegate('attacherizr').attachWithRubberBand();
      
      this.base('insertKeysIntoApple', keys);
    };
  </pre>
  So I am imagining that the <code>attachWithRubberBand</code> method turned out to be
  <i>seriously fucking complex</i> and needed to be moved into an object of its own so
  all that science (What kind of rubber band? Is it a big cup or a little one?)
  could be encapsulated in one spot.

<h3>Enviromentally Sound</h3>
<p> 
  Delegates promote reuse, like a recyle bin, except they are way less complicated regarding
  their use. There are no restrictions based on the plasticity rating or color of glass, just
  instantiate and call, then stuff happens. Other objects may wish to share in this feel-good story. Let them,
  it's good for us all.
</p>
<h3>Other Advantageousness</h3>
<p>
  You may be wondering, "What's for lunch?", or "What's the need to use a delegate when I can just
  'mixin' useful stuff to my Class Object via <code>extend</code> (maybe even using <code>sudo.extensions</code>)?" Well, 
  I'll tell you. It's sushi rolls and primarily because <code>sudo.Delegate</code> Class Objects have
  their own constructors whereas mixin type objects do not. Yep, in the game where you have to have your own
  constructor to score points, it's <code>Delegates</code> 1, composite types 0.
